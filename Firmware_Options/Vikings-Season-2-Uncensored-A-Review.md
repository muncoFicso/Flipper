One of the highlights of Vikings Season 2 Uncensored is the epic battle of Kattegat, where Ragnar and his allies face off against Jarl Borg (ThorbjÃ¸rn Harr) and King Horik (Donal Logue), who have invaded his homeland. The battle is full of bloodshed, betrayal, and heroism, and showcases the skills and courage of the Viking warriors. The uncensored version shows more of the carnage and chaos of the war, as well as some shocking twists and turns.
 
Another memorable moment of Vikings Season 2 Uncensored is the introduction of Princess Aslaug (Alyssa Sutherland), a mysterious and beautiful woman who claims to be pregnant with Ragnar's child. Her arrival causes a rift between Ragnar and Lagertha, who decides to leave him and become an earl in her own right. Aslaug also brings with her a prophecy that foretells the fate of her sons, who will become important figures in the Viking saga.
 
Vikings Season 2 Uncensored also explores the culture and religion of the Vikings, as well as their interactions with other civilizations. We see how Ragnar and his followers embrace Christianity in order to gain favor with King Ecbert (Linus Roache) of Wessex, who offers them land in exchange for their services. We also see how Athelstan (George Blagden), a former monk who was captured by Ragnar, struggles with his faith and identity as he lives among the pagans. We also witness the rituals and sacrifices that the Vikings perform to honor their gods and ancestors.
